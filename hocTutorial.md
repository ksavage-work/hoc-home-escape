## Introduction @unplugged
We'll need to go through each room until we find the front door. 
You've been in your room all of quarantine so there shouldn't be any obstaclesâ€¦ WAIT! 
It looks like someone locked your door. I guess you'll have to pick the lock using code. 

## Room 1, intro @fullscreen
In order to pick this block, you need to use an Event block. An event is something that 
triggers the code to run. In this case, the event is being near the door, and the code 
that will run is picking the lock.

## Room 1, pt 1
You can only pick the lock when you're close to the door. From the ``||hoc:hoc||`` drawer in the Toolbox, 
find the ``||hoc:When near door||`` Event block and drag it into the workspace.

## Room 1, pt 2
When you're near the door you'll need to pick the lock to make it open. From the ``||hoc:hoc||`` drawer, find the 
``||hoc:pick lock||`` block and drag it into the ``||hoc:When near door||`` Event block. 

Try going up to the door to pick the lock!

## Room 2, intro @ fullscreen
You made it to your parent's office! Geez, it looks like no ones dusted in here in weeks. 
Uh oh! Some evil dust bunnies are blocking the door. They look angry. Don't touch them or 
they might attack. Let's use the fan to blow them away. 

## Room 2, pt 1
Let's make the fan turn on when you press the **B** button. From the ``||controller:controller||`` 
Toolbox drawer, find the ``||controller:on B pressed||`` block and drag it into the workspace.
